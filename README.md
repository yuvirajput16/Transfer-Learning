# Transfer Learning with MobileNetV2 for Flower Classification

## Overview
This repository contains code for performing transfer learning using the MobileNetV2 pre-trained model for flower classification. The model is fine-tuned on a dataset containing five classes of flowers, and it achieves an accuracy of 80% after just 10 epochs.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of images from five different classes of flowers. These classes are [list the classes here, e.g., Rose, Sunflower, Tulip, Daisy, Lily]. The dataset is structured into training and testing sets, ensuring a robust evaluation of the model's performance.
